- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tmn24
- This page will serve as a record of any of the personal projects I have mostly finished and am proud of.
- I occasionally work on personal projects revolving around anything I'm interested at the time. I like to design solutions all from scratch. Generally, anything I post here will solely be made by me.
- This ranges from numerically solving differential equations to simulating discus throws with certain initial conditions.
- I'm currently (as of 3/5/2024) an Aerospace Engineering student at Kent State University.
- I'm interested in difficult math problems that require optimal solutions. Sometimes that involves numerical solutions. Which means, programming!

- I've worked a lot in Java, Python, Matlab, and dabbled in some C++.
